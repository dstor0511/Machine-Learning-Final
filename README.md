# Machine Learning Assignment: MNIST Classification

This assignment implements the universal deep learning workflow (DLWP 4.5) to build and optimize a neural network classifier for the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. The project follows a structured approach: problem definition, data preprocessing, baseline model development, regularization experiments, hyperparameter tuning, and final evaluation on held-out test data.

The model is restricted to TensorFlow Sequential architecture with Dense and Dropout layers (DLWP Part 1), emphasizing foundational deep learning principles. The notebook documents each stage with markdown sections, training metrics, and interpretation of results to demonstrate understanding of model behavior, overfitting, and regularization techniques.

**Timeline:** February 18–28, with iterative development from baseline through optimized model selection and test set evaluation.
