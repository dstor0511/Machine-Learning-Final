    "# Handwritten Digit Classification on the MNIST Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project applies the universal workflow of machine learning from *Deep Learning with Python* (Chapter 4.5, 1st edition) to the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. The goal is to build, analyze, and improve a neural network that can recognize digits from images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify images of handwritten digits (0–9) from the MNIST dataset. This is a supervised learning problem, where the model is trained on labeled examples of images and their corresponding digit classes. Each input is a 28×28 grayscale image, and the model outputs a label indicating which digit (0–9) it predicts for that image. The MNIST dataset is a widely used benchmark in machine learning and computer vision, consisting of 70,000 images in total: 60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "MNIST is an ideal choice for this project because it is relatively small, easy to load and preprocess, and has been extensively studied, which makes it well suited for learning and comparing different model configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the models are restricted to Keras/TensorFlow Sequential architectures built only from Dense and Dropout layers, without using more complex layers such as convolutional layers. This constraint reflects the course requirements and encourages a focus on understanding the core ideas of fully connected neural networks and regularization, rather than relying on more advanced architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main metric for success in this project is classification accuracy on a held‑out test set, measuring the proportion of correctly classified digit images. The goal is to build a model that achieves high accuracy while following the DLWP universal workflow, rather than necessarily reaching state‑of‑the‑art performance. Additional metrics such as precision, recall, and F1‑score will be considered during evaluation to provide a more detailed picture of model performance, particularly if class imbalance or specific error types become relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow for this project follows the universal machine learning process described in Deep Learning with Python: defining the problem and dataset, choosing a success metric, and deciding on an evaluation protocol. After that, the data will be prepared and split, a baseline model will be built and evaluated, a larger model will be trained to intentionally overfit, and finally regularization techniques and hyperparameter tuning will be applied based on validation performance to improve generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the universal workflow of machine learning from Deep Learning with Python is followed step by step. The problem and dataset are first defined, along with the success metric and evaluation protocol. The data is then loaded, preprocessed, and split into training, validation, and test sets. A simple baseline model is built and evaluated, followed by a larger model that is allowed to overfit in order to explore the model’s capacity. Finally, regularization techniques and hyperparameter tuning are applied to improve generalization, and the best model is evaluated on the test set and discussed in terms of its strengths, limitations, and possible extensions."

    "## 1. Problem definition and dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem addressed in this project is the classification of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9), each of size 28×28 pixels. It is split into a training set of 60,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images. This is a supervised multiclass classification problem, where the goal is to train a model that takes an image as input and outputs the correct digit label.\n",
    "\n",
    "MNIST is a good choice for this project because it is widely used in the machine learning community, making it easy to compare results with existing work. It is also relatively small and straightforward to load and preprocess, which allows us to focus on the modeling aspects rather than on complex data handling. Additionally, the task of digit classification is a well‑defined and intuitive problem that serves as a gentle introduction to image classification and neural networks."

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because MNIST is a relatively simple and well‑studied benchmark, many models achieve very high performance on this dataset. For this reason, this project considers a test accuracy above 99% as the target for a successful model, rather than treating lower accuracies (e.g. 90–95%) as sufficient. Additional metrics such as precision, recall, and F1‑score will be considered during evaluation to provide a more detailed picture of model performance, particularly if class imbalance or specific error types become relevant."

    "The original MNIST dataset provides 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. In this project, the 60,000 training images are further split into 50,000 training samples and 10,000 validation samples. The 50,000 training samples are used to fit the parameters of the neural network, while the 10,000 validation samples are used to monitor performance during development and to guide choices such as model architecture, number of epochs, and regularization strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 10,000 test images are kept completely separate from the training and validation process and are only used once, at the end of the project, to obtain an unbiased estimate of the final model’s generalization performance.\n",
    "This train/validation/test setup helps prevent overfitting to the test set and ensures that any improvements observed on the validation set reflect genuine improvements in the model, rather than adaptation to a single held‑out benchmark.\n"

In contrast, the baseline dense neural network trained in this project reaches approximately 99.6% training accuracy and 97.4% validation accuracy after 5 epochs.

    "### Regularization with Dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce overfitting in the larger dense network, Dropout layers were added after each hidden layer. The resulting architecture consists of two hidden Dense layers with 256 ReLU units each, with Dropout(0.5) applied after each hidden layer, followed by a 10-unit softmax output layer. During training, Dropout randomly sets 50% of the units in the previous layer to zero at each update step, which prevents the network from relying too heavily on specific neurons and encourages more robust feature learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to the original larger model without Dropout, which achieved approximately 99.96% training accuracy and 98.29% validation accuracy, the Dropout-regularized model achieved about 97.58% training accuracy and 98.05% validation accuracy after 20 epochs. This indicates that Dropout makes the training task harder (lower training accuracy) but helps control overfitting by narrowing the gap between training and validation performance, while maintaining a high level of validation accuracy. As a result, the Dropout model is better aligned with the goal of good generalization, rather than simply memorizing the training set.\n",

    "\n",
    "After selecting a set of candidate models and tuning their architectures and regularization, the last step is to evaluate them on the held-out test set of 10,000 MNIST images. The test set has not been used during training or model selection, so its performance provides an unbiased estimate of how well each model generalizes to new data. For each of the four trained models (baseline small dense, big dense, big dense with Dropout, and small dense with Dropout), the final validation accuracy from training is recorded and the model is then evaluated once on the test set to obtain its test accuracy."

    "The four models show a consistent pattern between validation and test performance, indicating that the chosen train/validation/test split provides a reliable estimate of generalization. The baseline small dense network achieves around 97.5% accuracy on both validation and test data, while increasing capacity to a larger dense network without Dropout improves performance to approximately 98.2% validation accuracy and 98.25% test accuracy. Adding Dropout(0.5) to the large network slightly reduces training accuracy (not shown here) and yields about 98.07% validation accuracy and 98.00% test accuracy, very close to the unregularized large model. The smaller Dropout-regularized model performs similarly to the baseline, with validation and test accuracies around 97.5%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because training uses random weight initialization and mini‑batch sampling, the exact training, validation, and test accuracies are not perfectly reproducible across runs, even with identical hyperparameters. This stochastic behaviour is a general limitation of neural networks and should be kept in mind when interpreting small differences in accuracy between models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these results illustrate that higher-capacity models achieve better accuracy on MNIST, and that Dropout can be used to regularize such models while maintaining high validation and test performance. Given the small difference between the large unregularized and large Dropout models, the big + Dropout configuration is selected as the final model for this project because it combines near-best accuracy with stronger regularization and more stable generalization behaviour.\n"
